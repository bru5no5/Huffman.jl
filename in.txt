Call my mother, call my mother now
I'm laying on the couch like I am six feet under
Just lay something on my feet
I see you everywhere now
In every billboard, every corner
I tiptoe at the edge of a cliff
'Cause I see your face in the water

Am I being paranoid?
I tried to leave it all behind
I really tried

But I go to places, I see them changing
I go sit by your front door
Drinking something with an empty stomach
How can I know for sure?
If the pain is real, then why can't I find the cure?

I see colors never seen before
Are these people smiling or are they're praying I get over you?
I write down almost everything
'Cause all that's left of me is what's left of our memory
And I can see you everywhere now

Am I being paranoid?
I tried to leave it all behind
I really tried

I go to places, but now I'm famous
I can't sit by your front door
Drinking something with an empty stomach
How can I know for sure?
If the pain is real, then why can't I find the cure?

The cure
Ah-ah-ah
The cure
Ah-ah-ah
Find the cure

I'd search you in all of my lives
Just to learn what it would be like
To live a great story with the love of my life
I see you everywhere these days
Why can't you recognize my face anymore?

If the pain is real, then why can't I find the cure?
Mm-mm-mm-mm
